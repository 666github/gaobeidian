1
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:12,986
Now let us focus on new understanding of the origin

2
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:15,946
of Chinese civilization according to some understanding

3
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:18,466
of the Neolithic age we just talked about

4
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:21,626
To sum up in fact there are two points

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,506
One is from the exotic to domestic

6
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,746
Another is from monism to pluralism

7
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:28,786
Let's look at the first one from the exotic to domestic

8
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:29,706
What is exotic

9
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:32,706
It means the Chinese civilization came from the west

10
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:33,986
Who brought up this idea

11
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:37,906
In last century a Swedish scholars Andersson proposed it

12
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:39,946
Andersson is a Swedish geologist

13
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:41,946
He was invited by Beiyang government

14
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:43,826
at the beginning of the last century

15
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:45,346
It was about 1915 or 1914

16
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,026
By the Beiyang government's invitation

17
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,986
He came to China to carry out geological survey

18
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:57,106
Especially for iron ore investigation

19
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:59,426
Andersson was a very professional scholar

20
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:01,746
In addition to the investigation of iron ore

21
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:03,506
he had done a lot of other jobs

22
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:06,466
Especially made a major impetus for Chinese ancient

23
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:07,746
Neolithic discovery

24
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:09,066
He found it in 1921

25
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,386
China's first Neolithic site

26
00:01:11,426 --> 00:01:13,146
It is found in Henan Yangshao

27
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:14,986
Let us look at this picture of Yangshao

28
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:18,466
It is the excavation site of Yangshao Village in 1921

29
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:21,146
He named Culture Yangshao culture

30
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,266
This is the first discovery of China's

31
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:24,906
ruins of the Neolithic Culture

32
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,906
It can be said Andersson is one of

33
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:28,386
the founders of the pioneer

34
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:30,626
of Chinese modern archaeology

35
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,866
What is typical of the Yangshao culture

36
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:34,546
It¡¯s the painted pottery culture

37
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:36,506
Is the pottery, pottery culture

38
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:39,266
Andersson discovered Gansu Qijia Culture

39
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:41,986
After he found Yangshao culture sites

40
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:45,146
Qijia culture is also a kind of painted pottery culture

41
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:48,306
In that background then Mr. Andersson believed

42
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:51,506
Qijia Culture was the upper reaches of the Yangshao culture

43
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,786
Which means Qijia culture affected Yangshao culture

44
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:57,026
What can Qijia culture be compared with

45
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,266
That would be Mesopotamia pottery culture

46
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:01,386
Which was excavated more at that time

47
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:04,386
Therefore, Mr. Andersson came up a conclusion

48
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:08,066
Mesopotamia pottery culture influenced Qijia Culture

49
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:11,466
Qijia culture also influenced Yangshao culture

50
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,986
Such a development context and clues

51
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,026
It should be said that at that time we knew

52
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:17,706
Such a point of view is reasonable

53
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:20,586
That is to say the point of view is reasonable

54
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:23,483
But this exotic theory was challenged later

55
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,163
Where did this challenge come from

56
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:28,163
It also came from the archaeological discovery

57
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:30,523
Because later scholars actually discovered

58
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,563
ruins of Pei Ligang culture Which

59
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,363
is earlier than Qijia culture

60
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:36,763
Scholars have found that in fact

61
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,123
Yangshao culture affected the Qijia Culture

62
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:42,763
Instead of Qijia culture influenced of Yangshao culture

63
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:44,003
Actually to Andersson

64
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:46,803
what he saw in the direction of the culture was wrong

65
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:48,883
So that the exotic theory was impacted

66
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:51,643
Moreover, in fact painted pottery culture

67
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:53,163
is not a high-tech culture

68
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:56,763
With proper clay actually all parts of the world can produce

69
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:59,003
So this kind of painted pottery culture

70
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:01,243
Doesn¡¯t need to be explained as exotic

71
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:04,923
This is how exotic theory slowly turned into domestic theory

72
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,963
Now we can say that domestic theory

73
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,923
Is basically admitted by international scholars

74
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:13,123
It means Chinese civilization has its own origin

75
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:14,323
It has its own origin

76
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,963
That is what we say from exotic to domestic

77
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,563
Another aspect is from monism to pluralism

78
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:20,523
What is monism

79
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,763
Monism simply means all from central

80
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,083
Which means in the ancient history system

81
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,963
the development of our civilization

82
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:28,403
was From central China

83
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:32,003
Actually it has been challenged by scholars and impacted

84
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:33,843
Gradually from last century

85
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:37,723
Mr. Gu Jiegang's ideological trend of suspecting the ancient

86
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:40,923
in fact, broke the monism Is to break the monism

87
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,563
Because he overthrew the ancient legend system

88
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:45,403
That was a break of monism Since

89
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:48,203
then Mr. Fu Sinian Mr. Wang Guowei

90
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:50,563
Mr. Meng Wentong and Mr. Xu Xusheng

91
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:52,883
separately put forward their own argument

92
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,283
from their own view point

93
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:56,243
Mr. Wang Guowei¡¯s opinion of the difference

94
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:58,203
between the Yin and Zhou Dynasties

95
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,283
believes Shang and Zhou were different

96
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,523
with different nation and different culture

97
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:05,363
Mr. Fu Sinian also put forward the barbarian

98
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:08,363
and Huaxia East and West Also claimed the

99
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:11,163
development of eastern China and western China

100
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:13,483
Mr. Meng Wentong and Mr. Xu Xusheng

101
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:16,803
respectively proposed the development of the three series

102
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:19,443
This is from monism to pluralism development

103
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:22,483
Along with the increase of the archaeological finds

104
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:25,243
Mr. Su Bingqi's point of view we mentioned before

105
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:29,043
how did Mr. Su Bingqi describe the origin of this civilization

106
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,483
He is used The sky was covered with stars to describe it

107
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,803
There are a lot of Neolithic civilization

108
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:38,643
all around China stood on the threshold of civilization

109
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:42,123
So he used The sky was covered with stars to illustrate it

110
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,083
This is a typical view of pluralism

111
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,123
But we also need to notice a phenomenon

112
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:47,963
Although many cultures had been

113
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:50,403
standing on the threshold of civilization

114
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:52,603
and almost stepped into the civilization

115
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,563
But when it comes to forming a country

116
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:56,083
we know the earliest country

117
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:58,163
was still formed in central China

118
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:01,043
In other words the development of the central China

119
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,043
eventually leading to other areas

120
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,203
How to explain such a phenomenon

121
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:08,683
Yan Wenming, Professor of the Department of archaeology

122
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:11,883
called it concentric petals structure Such a point of view

123
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:15,603
The so-called concentric actually refers to Central China

124
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:18,203
Why the central China was able to form a country

125
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:19,443
To this question

126
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,363
so far I don't think there's a good

127
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:22,883
and satisfactory answer

128
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,763
we also put forward a thinking for your reference

129
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,923
Central China is located in the ground

130
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:31,083
Where was the junction of agricultural civilization

131
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,563
and nomadic civilization

132
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:35,443
In the junction there would be more conflicts and wars

133
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:38,043
War was an important reason to from countries

134
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,603
That may be one of the reasons

135
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:42,603
why earliest countries were formed in central China

136
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,883
In order to explain such a phenomenon

137
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:48,643
Mr. Yan Wenming pointed out the concentric petals structure

138
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,043
Later, we know Mr. Fei Xiaotong

139
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,563
looked at a more macro problem

140
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,563
and put forward the pluralism integration of multiple

141
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:58,843
He put forward the structure of pluralism integration.

142
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:01,843
He did not just focus on the origin of civilization

143
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:05,083
also concerned about the development of Chinese nation

144
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,123
We'll talk about it

145
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:07,443
In short we can see

146
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:10,203
The cognition of origin of Chinese civilization

147
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,043
went from monism to pluralism

148
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,443
The reference books for you

149
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:16,043
is Mr. Su Bingqi¡¯s and Mr. Yan Wenming¡¯s

150
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,363
works To which we can further reference

151
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:19,843
That is our new understanding

152
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:22,226
of the origin of our civilization

153
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:22,226
